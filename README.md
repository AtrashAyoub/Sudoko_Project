# Sudoko_Project

### In the project we created an interactive Sudoku program with an ILP (Integer Programming) solver component. use ILP to both solve Sudoku puzzles and check possible solutions to it. 
### ILP uses mathematical optimization methods to speed up the solution time, compared to the exponential backtracking algorithm.
